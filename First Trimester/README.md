# First Trimester - Sanzid Ahmed

Welcome to the **First Trimester (ICS)** folder! This folder contains all the coursework, assignments, and assessments from my first semester at university. The focus of the first trimester was to build foundational knowledge in programming and computer science. This repository serves as an archive for the work I completed during this period.

## üìÇ Folder Overview

In this folder, you will find:
- **Class Tests**: Solutions and notes from the class tests I completed during the trimester.
- **University Assignments**: The three university assignments related to the first trimester.
- **Homework**: Practice exercises and homework assignments I worked on.
- **Midterm Exam**: Questions and answers from the midterm exam for my first trimester courses.
- **Final Exam**: Questions and answers from the final exam for my first trimester courses.

## üìò First Trimester Course Topics

During this trimester, I learned the following key topics:

### **1. C Programming Basics**
- **Hello World Program**: Introduction to writing and running your first program in C.
- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding how to declare and use variables.
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, logical, and relational operators in C.

### **2. Control Structures**
- **Conditional Statements**: If-else, nested if-else, and switch-case statements.
- **Loops**: For loops, while loops, and do-while loops.
- **Nested Loops**: Combining loops for more complex logic.

### **3. Flowcharts and Pseudocode**
- **Flowchart Basics**: How to visually represent algorithms and processes using flowcharts.
- **Pseudocode**: Writing simple pseudocode to outline logic before translating it into code.
- **Algorithm Representation**: Using flowcharts and pseudocode to design problem-solving steps clearly and logically.

### **4. Computer Fundamentals & General Knowledge**
- **Memory (RAM)**: Basic understanding of RAM and its role in computer systems.
- **Computer Terminology**: Learning common computer terminology and acronyms.
- **General Knowledge**: Understanding the basics of hardware, software, and how computers function.

### **5. Problem-Solving**
- Solving simple programming problems using C programming language and applying the concepts learned, including flowcharts and pseudocode for problem analysis and solution planning.

## üíª Technologies Used

Throughout this trimester, I primarily focused on **C programming**, which forms the foundation for my early learning in computer science.
